## Introduction
Welcome to the course! Before we start in on the *hows* of social media marketing, let's establish the *why*. Let me throw some numbers at you.

- Facebook has over a billion users, and Instagram has 700 million.
- The average American spends 2 hours per day on social media.
- In 2017, an estimated $36 billion dollars had been spent on social media ads.
- 40 million small businesses currently maintain an active Facebook Page
- And finally, 76% of consumers want to connect with businesses on Facebook.

The point is: the marketing needs of businesses have changed, and are continuing to. This class will equip you to handle new and future ways to market to your audience.

## The Three Key Marketing Needs
### Create Awareness
__Who Needs This: New and small organizations__

* Let people know about you
* Help them discover you
* Let them begin to engage with you

### Pique Interest
__Who Needs This: Anyone creating awareness__

* Help people understand more about you
* What do you offer?
* What is unique about you?
* Help people engage with you

### Get Customers and Grow Sales
__Who Needs This: Most organizations, including all businesses__

- Attract new customers to buy or use your services
- Attract new members to join your group
- Attract donors to your cause

## Understanding your target audience

#### So how *do* you determine who your organization is trying to reach?

We actually have tools on Facebook to determine the information, but we'll get into that later. For now, just ask! If you're an organization's leader, it's unlikely you don't know your audience, right? The same goes for clients or colleagues.

### Placeholder For Activity

This will provide multiple examples of facebook organizations, and ask students to determine their social marketing needs (creating awareness, piquing interest, getting customers)

### Placeholder For 1-3 Examples

This will show off organizations that do it "right." Though we'll just be going over what makes the accounts good, I'm still verifying with some old job places to see if they'd be okay with specifically singling them out.

Our final example with be SavvyCoders itself, as we can discuss our own state, and familiarize everyone with a page we'll be revisiting often.

## Creating Your Page

To create your Facebook page, it's best to use a computer for the job. However, tablets and smartphones  are perfectly fine.

#### "Wait, What Do I Need to Start?"
 * __Have an account!__ If you don't have your own Facebook account already, you'll need to make one. It's easy and straightforward to set up - you don't need any special settings attached, just yourself.

 * __Basic Information!__ What's their address? What's their mission? Who works there (and wants to be listed on the page)? What's their phone number?
 Chances are pretty good you already have this info, but in the event you don't, you can always continue. *Just be sure it's accurate!* Misleading information can be worse than none at all. Better to err on the side of caution.

### The Elements of a Page

  * Page name
  * Cover image
  * Profile image
  * Add a Button/Call to Action

### "What Do I Need, Now That It's Made?"

  Once you've made your page, you're going to need to manage it. This entails tasks such as posting regularly and keeping up with several things. We'll get more in depth with the following in later classes:

  * Notifications
  * Messages
  * Insights
  * About
  * Settings

## Let's Get Our Hands Dirty!

Time to make a page! Now that you have your information (and preferably, images), we can create a page. Navigate to the left-hand sidebar of your main feed page. You'll see a spot at a bottom, labelled with *Create.* You'll soon be familiar with all of these options! For now, select *Page*, and get going!

## Security Settings

#### First, let's see what ways you can control your vistors' activity on your page.
Select *Settings* from your new page. You'll be at the *general* section. Here, you can see some helpful options:
* __Visitor Posts:__ Allow visitors to directly post photos and videos on your page, or choose to review and approve each of these posts.
* __Messages:__ Allow visitors to contact you directly through Messenger.
* __Tagging Ability:__ You can allow visitors and other pages to tag photos on your page.
* __Profanity Filter:__ Prevent profanity or curse words. This is a bit more advanced, and worth investigating personally!

#### Let's take a moment to set your security settings, and ensure they're working.

##  Basics of Page Promotion
__Insert Photos and Videos__

While creating a post, you can use the dropdown menu to the right, then click *Upload Photos/Video.*

  __Publish Your Post__

  Once you're ready, just use the dropdown and select *publish.* This will publish your post to your page's timeline and distributed to followers' personal feeds.

  __Invite People To Like Your Page__

  If you're going to build an audience, you're going to need to start somewhere! On your page's sidebar, you can find the option to search for friends to invite.

  __Promote Your Page Elsewhere__

  Give folks who visit your site the chance to join you on Facebook. A good way to accomplish this is by using a Follow Us On Facebook button on your site. In your account settings, select *Settings*, navigate to the *Followers* section, then copy and paste the HTML you'll find there (in the *Follow Plugin* field).

  ## Key Elements of Successful Pages

    * __Regular, interesting status updates__
    * __An interesting 'About' section__
    * __A good cover photo or image__
